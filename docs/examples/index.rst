**Note:** for a more recent example of using *metaknowledge*, please visit `the NetLab blog <https://uwaterloo.ca/networks-lab/blog/post/network-analysis-metaknowledge>`_.

*metaknowledge* is a python library for creating and analyzing scientific metadata. It uses records obtained from Web of Science (WOS), Scopus and other sources. It is intended to be usable by those who do not know much python. This page will be a short overview of its capabilities, to allow you to use it for your own work. 

This document was made from a `jupyter <https://jupyter.org>`_ notebook, if you know how to use them, you can download the notebook |notebook|_ and the sample file is `here <networkslab.org/metaknowledge/examples/savedrecs.txt>`_ if you wish to have an interactive version of this page. Now let's begin.
