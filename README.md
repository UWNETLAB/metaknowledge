# metaknowledge

_metaknowledge_ is a Python3 library that simplifies bibliometric research using data from various sources. It reads a directory of plain text files containing meta-data on publications and citations, and writes to a variety of data structures that are suitable for quantitative, network, and text analyses. It handles large datasets (e.g. several million records) efficiently.
